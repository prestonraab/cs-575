    "This notebook demonstrates how to use graphlets to analyze the local structure around vertices in a network. We'll practice computing graphlet signatures and interpret what they tell us about vertex positions and roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the broader context of this class, which includes a focus on helping you to learn how to do graph data science. An important set of tools for graph data science use data-driven models like neural networks and clustering algorithms. Data-driven models often require feature engineering, where a data engineer designs features that make it easier for the data-driven models to learn or be tuned. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a graphlet signature for a vertex as a **vertex feature**. Specifically, a vertex's graphlet signature extracts feature information about local structural properties around the vertex."
