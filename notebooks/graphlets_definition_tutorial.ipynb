The problem with that is that just counting vertices doesn't work well when we try to check edge structure.  \n",

    "By keeping track of which vertex is the root, rooted graphlets capture information about **position and role** within the local network structure. A vertex in a central hub position experiences a fundamentally different local neighborhood than a vertex on the periphery, and rooted graphlets distinguish between these roles. This is precisely what we need to compute meaningful graphlet signatures: a count vector that characterizes not just what neighbors are present, but where our specific vertex sits within the local structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why researchers use rooted graphlets for network analysis: they provide a more nuanced vocabulary for describing **local structure**, that is, how a vertex is embedded in its local neighborhood. Better understanding of local structure enables better differentiation between different types of vertices and their roles in the network.\n",

Recall that a triple is any path of three vertices, while a triad is a triple where all three vertices are mutually connected (a complete triangle). This distinction was crucial: we counted triads, not triples, because triads tell us about the local structure around a vertex in a more meaningful way. Here's a screen shot from a class slide to jog your memory.\n",

This ensures that when we count graphlets around a vertex, we're capturing the actual connectivity structure rather than incomplete or artificial subgraphs. In other words, induced subgraphs are the graphlet analogue to triads: they represent the real local structure that matters for network analysis.\n"

    "\n",
    "Here's an important observation: Why don't the subgraphs `A-C-D`, `A-D-C`, and `C-A-D` appear in our list of extracted subgraphs? (Read the dashes as representing single edges between vertices.) Each of these is a path of three vertices, which we called a **triplet** in the discussion of local clustering coefficient, but each uses only 2 of the 3 available edges that connect these vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from our earlier discussion: the local clustering coefficient counts how many triplets containing a vertex are actually triads. The key insight is that begin part of triad tells us something different about local graph structure than just being part of a triplet. Being part of a triad means your neighbors are connected to each other, that is, the vertices are tightly clustered. A triplet with a missing edge tells a different story: it suggests looser connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphlets apply the same principle. When we extract a subgraph from the original graph by selecting a set of vertices, we should **preserve the actual connectivity that exists** in the original graph. If the original graph has an edge between two of our selected vertices, that edge must appear in our subgraph. If we omit an edge that actually exists, we create a false representation of the local structure.\n",

By only including some of the edges, they hide the tight clustering that actually exists. Instead, we use subgraphs that include **all edges from the original graph** connecting our selected vertices. These are called **induced subgraphs**, and they guarantee we're capturing the true local structure."
